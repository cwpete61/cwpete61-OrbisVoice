# OrbisVoice Brand Direction

## Brand Essence
- Positioning: Real-time voice AI infrastructure for businesses that need speed, clarity, and control.
- Personality: Precise, calm, technical, trustworthy.
- Keywords: Resonant, orbital, low-latency, duplex, adaptive.

## Visual Direction
- Look: Deep space meets studio hardware. Smooth gradients, crisp lines, and a subtle signal motif.
- Shapes: Concentric arcs, orbital paths, and waveform accents (used sparingly).
- Texture: Fine grain or subtle noise to prevent flat surfaces.

## Color System (Proposed)
Primary:
- Orbit Blue: #0B1B3B
- Signal Cyan: #37CBEA

Secondary:
- Plasma Orange: #FF7A3D
- Aurora Green: #2ED59D

Neutrals:
- Void: #060B14
- Slate: #1C2433
- Mist: #E6EDF5

Usage:
- Primary UI surfaces on Orbit Blue / Void.
- Highlights and buttons in Signal Cyan.
- Use Plasma Orange only for CTAs or critical emphasis.

## Typography
Primary (Headlines):
- "Space Grotesk" or "Sora"

Secondary (Body):
- "IBM Plex Sans" or "DM Sans"

Code / Metrics:
- "IBM Plex Mono"

Rules:
- Large headers with tight tracking.
- Body copy at 16-18px with generous line-height.

## Motion
- Ambient gradient drift (8-12s loop).
- Staggered content reveals (40-80ms offset).
- Micro-interactions: single-axis slides or fades, avoid bounce.

## Iconography
- Thin line icons with rounded terminals.
- Use waveform and orbit themes, minimal fill.

## Imagery
- Prefer abstract audio waveforms, studio hardware closeups, or neural motifs.
- Avoid generic AI faces or stock robots.

## Logo Direction
- Wordmark: "OrbisVoice" with a subtle orbit arc over the "O".
- Optional mark: concentric orbit with a waveform cutout.

## Accessibility
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.
- Avoid relying solely on color to indicate status.

## Notes
- There is a reference image in assets/images. Incorporate it as a moodboard anchor once reviewed.
